# FixMyStreet PWA iOS Wrapper

An iOS app built with [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) that wraps
the FMS progressive web app for publishing on the iOS App Store.

## Installation/Building

You'll need Xcode and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) (`brew install cocoapods` should do the trick.)

 1. Run `pod install` from within the `src` directory
 1. `open FixMyStreet.xcworkspace`
 1. You should be able to build/run the app, though may need to tell Xcode to automatically manage code signing.
