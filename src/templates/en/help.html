<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<dl>
    <dt>What is FixMyStreet?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet is a website to help people report, view,
    or discuss local problems they&rsquo;ve found to their local council by
    simply locating them on a map. It launched in early February
    2007.</dd>
    <dt>How do I use this app?</dt>
    <dd>The app will either locate you automatically or you can enter a postcode or location. You 
    will see a map of that area on which you can view problems already reported in that area. To
    start reporting a problem scroll the map till the crosshair is over the location of the problem and
    press 'Report a problem here'.</dd>

    <dt>What happens to the information I enter?</dt>
    <dd><strong>All the information you enter will be sent to the council</strong>.
        The title, category and details of your report will be displayed on the website. By default
        your name will also be displayed on the website but you can choose to have this hidden.
        We will <strong>never display your email or phone number on the site</strong>.</dd>

    <dt>What if I want to remain anonymous?</dt>
    <dd>You can opt not to have you name displayed on the website when entering your details. 
    <strong>Your name, email and phone number, if you provided it, will always be sent to the council.</strong></dd>

    <dt>What if I've included personal information in a report</dt>
    <dd>To have a report edited email <a href="mailto:support@fixmystreet.com">support@fixmystreet.com</a> with 
        details of the report.</dd>

    <dt>What sort of problems should I report with FixMyStreet?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet is primarily for reporting things which are
    <strong>broken or dirty or damaged or dumped, and need fixing, cleaning
    or clearing</strong>.</dd>

    <dt>What isn&rsquo;t FixMyStreet for?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet is not a way of getting in touch with your council for all
    issues &ndash; please use FixMyStreet only for problems such as the above. We
    often route problem reports via cleansing services or highways and so using
    FixMyStreet for other matters may result in a delay in your report getting
    to the right department.</dd>
